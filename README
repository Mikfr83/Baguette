Baguette is a drag, drop and connect system rig. Each item you create is a module which carries all the data of that item.
The goal of this system is to provide the ability to easily develop rigs by junior riggers, but at the same time be capable of developing advanced rigs by a more senior rigger.

To launch Baguette UI:
from Baguette import reload_package
reload_package()

To use some of the rigUtils : 
from Baguette.rigModule import rigUtils

#copy skinning
rigUtils.copySkin(source, sel)

#mirror some shape
rigUtils.mirrorShape()
